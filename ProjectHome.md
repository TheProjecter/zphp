A quick 'n dirty PHP framework, focussing on speed.

Has basic MVC support, basic routing support, basic view tools, basic ...

Idea is to keep things basic 'n simple.

MIT license only applies to Z framework files.

The Z framework has build-in support for Smarty (LGPL) templates, and uses the database component from ezComponents (New BDS license).

Does currently depend on the Zend loader, but this dependency will soon be removed!

Requires:
  * PHP 5.3+
  * smarty (subversion external)
  * ezComponents database components (subversion external)
  * Zend Framework (not included on subversion)
  * jQuery (v1.4.2 included in demo)
  * jQuery UI (v1.8.4 included with blitzer theme included in demo)

Use this as a base for your own custom project, and start coding!

A simple and more advanced demo will be included to show off some of the features.
