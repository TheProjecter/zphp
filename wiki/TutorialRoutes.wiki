= Introduction =

Z framework has basic support for 'routes' (example map /admin/index to controller admin and action index)

= Details =

Basic routing (allowing /$controller$/$action$ and /$controller$/
{{{
$router = new Z_Router();

$router->addRoute( '/:controller:', array());
$router->addRoute( '/:controller:/:action:', array());

// Add it to the list of routers
Z_Application::getInstance()->routers[] = $router;
}}}

Advanced routing (custom mapping)

{{{
$router = new Z_Router();

$router->addRoute( '/hello/world', array('controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'helloworld'));

// Add it to the list of routers
Z_Application::getInstance()->routers[] = $router;
}}}
